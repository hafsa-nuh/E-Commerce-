# The Idea
We thought of doing an e-commerce site since there aren't many that are simply user friendly and to also build on our knowledge as this project touched on almost every topic we have covered. 
We have components for various pages in our application, well labeled and easy to use. 

# Design
There is a landing page that points to all of the site's features.
Well designed NavBar and footer, complete with routes to the available pages. Still on routing, some buttons have routes too, please click to find out!
We have reusable components like the title and paragraph text, creating some uniformity. 
For a great user experience, the UI/UX team used several slide styles, among them SliderJs and SwitchTransition component. 

# End Points
This being the first full stack project we have worked on, we were excited to see the the front end come together using an API we had created. Here are our endpoints for the crud operations:
`Products : https://aqueous-castle-47869.herokuapp.com/products`
`Customers: https://aqueous-castle-47869.herokuapp.com/customers`
`Orders: https://aqueous-castle-47869.herokuapp.com/orders`

# Running the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
